          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
AAGT Pvt Loans ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information in compliance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)
legalvision.com.au
. We manage personal information in an open and transparent way, and our policy is clearly expressed and up-to-date as required by law
oaic.gov.au
. By using our website or applying for a business loan, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">What Information We Collect</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
We only offer business loans, so we collect information relevant to business credit applications. The types of personal and business information we may collect include:

Personal Identification: Your name, date of birth, gender, job title, and contact details (e.g. phone number, email, residential address).

Business Details: Business name, business address, Australian Business Number (ABN) or Australian Company Number (ACN), and financial information about your business (such as revenue and debts).

Financial Information: Information needed to assess creditworthiness – for example, your credit history or credit score, income, assets and liabilities, and bank account details. This may include “credit information,” which is regarded as personal information under Australian law
business.qld.gov.au
.

Identification Documents: We may request IDs (like a driver’s licence or passport) to verify your identity, as required for fraud prevention or credit checks.

References and Other Details: If you provide references or the contact information of directors, guarantors or other related individuals, we collect those details as part of your application. We only collect sensitive information (e.g. membership of professional associations or criminal record) if necessary for a specific purpose and with your consent or as otherwise permitted by law.

You do not need to create an account to use our website. You can browse the site without identifying yourself or providing personal details. However, if you wish to apply for a loan or submit an inquiry, we will collect the personal and business information that you provide in the application form. Choosing not to provide certain details may mean we cannot process your loan application or offer you our services.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">How We Collect Information</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
We primarily collect personal information directly from you when you fill out our online loan application or contact forms. For example, you enter personal and business details into our application form on the website. We may also collect information through:

Communications: Information you provide when contacting us via email, phone, or through our website (e.g. queries or feedback).

Automatic Means: Basic technical information collected when you visit our site, such as your IP address, browser type, and cookies. We use cookies or similar technologies for functionality and analytics to improve our website experience. These may collect usage data, but typically do not identify you by name. You can adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies, though some site features may not function properly.

Third Parties: In some cases, we obtain information from third parties for verification and credit assessment. For instance, with your authorization, we may collect credit reports from credit reporting bodies, or verify details with your employer or stated references. We may also use publicly available sources (e.g. ASIC company registers or ABN lookup) to confirm business information. We will always collect and handle such third-party information in accordance with this Policy and applicable law.

If we receive personal information that we did not solicit (for example, someone else sends us your details unsolicited), we will determine if we could have collected it lawfully. If not, we will destroy or de-identify that information in accordance with our obligations.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Why We Collect Your Information (Purpose of Collection)</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
We collect and hold personal information for purposes related to our business lending services
business.qld.gov.au
. This includes:

Assessing Loan Applications: We use your information to evaluate your eligibility for a business loan. This involves verifying your identity, reviewing your business’s financial health, and performing credit and reference checks.

Credit and Reference Checks: By submitting an application, you acknowledge that we will use your personal and business details to obtain credit reports from credit reporting agencies and to contact referees or other credit providers to verify information. We only collect what is necessary to make responsible lending decisions.

Communicating with You: We use contact information (email, phone) to update you on your application 
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Disclosure of Personal Information (Who We Share It With)</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
We value your privacy and do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. However, in order to provide our services and operate our business, we may disclose your information to certain third parties for lending-related functions only, or as required by law. These third parties may include:

Credit Reporting Bodies (CRBs): We may share your identification details and credit information with licensed credit reporting agencies to obtain your credit report or credit score as part of assessing your loan application. This is done in accordance with Part IIIA of the Privacy Act and the Credit Reporting Code. The information we provide to CRBs may include the fact that you have applied for credit with us and relevant personal details. (Note: We will provide you with any required notifications or obtain consent if required before performing credit checks.)

Financial Institutions and Lenders: If we need to verify financial information, we might disclose relevant details to your bank or to other lenders you have dealt with (for example, to confirm loan payoff amounts or existing liabilities), but only with appropriate authority and for credit assessment purposes.

Service Providers: We use trusted third-party service providers to help us run our business. This can include: cloud data storage providers, IT support and security service providers, payment processing services, identity verification services, or professional advisors (such as lawyers or auditors). These providers may have access to personal information only to the extent necessary to perform their functions on our behalf. We require them to handle your data securely and in compliance with privacy law.

Business Partners or Affiliates: If AAGT Pvt Loans is part of a corporate group or has related entities, we may share information with our related companies as needed to service your loan or provide support. Any such sharing will still only be for the purposes outlined in this Policy (e.g. loan processing, compliance, or internal reporting).

Your Representatives: With your consent or at your direction, we may share information with third parties you nominate. For example, if you use a broker, accountant, or financial advisor in connection with your application, we can provide information to them at your request.

Legal or Regulatory: We may disclose personal information to government authorities, regulators, or law enforcement if required to by law or regulation. For instance, we might need to share information in response to a court order, subpoena, or to fulfill Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money Laundering obligations. We may also share information with our external dispute resolution scheme or the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) if necessary to resolve a complaint, or with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) in the event of a privacy investigation.

In all cases, we only disclose personal information for purposes that would be reasonably expected when using our lending services or as otherwise permitted under APP 6
oaic.gov.au
. We will not disclose your information to third parties for their own unrelated marketing or purposes without your consent. We ensure that any third party who receives personal information is subject to confidentiality obligations and required to handle the information in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Overseas Disclosure</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
Our business is based in Queensland, Australia, and we primarily store and process personal information within Australia. In general, we do not disclose your personal information to overseas recipients. All data is stored on secure servers located in Australia (or, if cloud-based, on servers that we have confirmed are in Australia or in jurisdictions with adequate data protection standards). If in the future we need to transfer personal data overseas (for example, using a cloud service or outsourcing a function abroad), we will only do so in compliance with the Privacy Act and APP 8, taking reasonable steps to ensure the overseas recipient does not breach the APPs
oaic.gov.au
. This means we will ensure your information is given a similar level of protection as it has in Australia before it is sent to any other country.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">How We Protect Your Information (Security)</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
We take the security of your personal information seriously. In accordance with APP 11, we take reasonable steps to protect personal information from misuse, interference, and loss, as well as unauthorized access, modification or disclosure
oaic.gov.au
. These steps include:

Secure Storage: We use secure servers and encryption protocols to store electronic records of your personal information. For example, our website is protected by HTTPS/SSL encryption to safeguard data you submit online. Data stored in our systems or cloud services is protected by firewalls, encryption at rest (where applicable), and access controls.

Access Controls: We restrict access to personal information to only those employees, contractors, or service providers who need it to perform their duties (on a need-to-know basis). Staff are trained on the importance of confidentiality and privacy. We implement password protections and, where appropriate, multi-factor authentication for systems that contain sensitive data.

Physical Security: For any physical documents (if any) containing personal data, we keep them in locked cabinets or secure premises accessible only by authorized personnel.

Security Policies and Monitoring: We maintain internal policies to guide secure handling of data. Our IT systems are monitored for unusual activity, and we regularly update and patch software to address security vulnerabilities. We also conduct periodic reviews of our security measures and may employ independent audits or penetration testing to ensure our safeguards remain effective.

Despite our best efforts, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of data. However, we follow industry best practices and take all reasonable precautions to prevent data breaches. In the unlikely event of a data breach that is likely to cause you serious harm, we will notify you and the OAIC in accordance with the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme under the Privacy Act.

We retain personal information only for as long as it is needed for our business purposes and legal obligations. When we no longer require your personal information (and it’s no longer required to be retained by law), we will take reasonable steps to destroy it or de-identify it in a secure manner
oaic.gov.au

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Your Rights and Choices</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
We are committed to upholding the rights that individuals have under Australian privacy law
business.qld.gov.au
business.qld.gov.au
. Below is a summary of your key rights and how you can exercise them:

Transparency and Awareness: You have the right to know why we collect your personal information, how we will use it, and who we might disclose it to
business.qld.gov.au
. We aim to provide this information to you at the time of collection (for example, via this Privacy Policy and notices on our forms). If you have any questions about our data practices, you can always contact us for more information.

Anonymity: Where possible, you have the option of not identifying yourself or using a pseudonym
business.qld.gov.au
 when dealing with us. On our website, you can browse general information without providing personal details. However, for services like loan applications, we will need to identify you to process the application, so anonymity is not feasible in that context.

Access to Your Information: You have the right to request access to personal information that we hold about you
business.qld.gov.au
. You may contact us (using the contact details in the Contact section below) to ask for a copy of your information. We will need to verify your identity before fulfilling any access request. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time (usually within 30 days). In some cases, we may refuse access where the law allows us to (for example, if granting access would unreasonably impact someone else’s privacy or if it relates to legal proceedings), but we will provide reasons if we do so.

Correction of Your Information: We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate, up-to-date, and complete
oaic.gov.au
. If you believe any information we have about you is incorrect, incomplete, or out-of-date, you have the right to request that we correct it
business.qld.gov.au
. You can contact us and let us know what needs to be corrected. If we disagree (for example, if we believe the information is accurate), we will provide an explanation and you can request we note your correction request on the record. We won’t charge you for making corrections.

Direct Marketing Opt-Out: We do not send out a lot of marketing materials, but if you are an existing customer or if you have subscribed to any updates, we may occasionally send information about our loan products or related services that we think could interest you. We will always do so in compliance with the Spam Act 2003 (e.g., only with your consent or if you would reasonably expect it, and with an easy opt-out)
business.qld.gov.au
. You have the right to opt out of receiving direct marketing communications at any time
business.qld.gov.au
. If you prefer not to receive promotional emails or texts, you can use the “unsubscribe” link in the message or contact us to be removed from our marketing list. There is no cost to unsubscribe. Please note that even if you opt out of marketing, we may still send you essential service or account-related communications (such as loan statements or notices).

Complaint about Privacy: If you believe that we have mishandled your personal information or breached this Privacy Policy or the APPs, you have the right to make a complaint and we will take it seriously
business.qld.gov.au
. We outline our complaints process in the section below.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Privacy Complaints and Inquiries</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
Feedback and Questions: If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback about how we handle your personal information, we encourage you to contact us. We are happy to provide additional information or clarification about our privacy practices.

Making a Complaint: If you believe we have not complied with our privacy obligations or have otherwise mishandled your personal information, you can lodge a complaint with us. Please send your complaint in writing (by email or letter) to our Privacy Officer (contact details are in the next section). Include as much detail as possible about the issue, so we can investigate it thoroughly (e.g., the date of the incident, what you believe went wrong, relevant circumstances).

Our Response: We will acknowledge your complaint and attempt to investigate and resolve it within a reasonable timeframe. We may contact you to request further information or to discuss the matter. We aim to provide you with a written response outlining the outcome of our investigation and any steps we will take to address your concerns.

Escalation: If you are not satisfied with our response, you have further options. In Australia, you can take your privacy complaint to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). The OAIC is the independent regulator that oversees privacy law. The OAIC can be contacted through their website (oaic.gov.au) and can investigate privacy complaints and make determinations. We kindly ask that you allow us the opportunity to resolve the issue first before contacting the OAIC, in line with recommended procedures
oaic.gov.au
. If we fail to respond to your complaint or if you are unhappy with the outcome, you can then seek assistance from the OAIC. In some cases (for example, if your complaint relates to credit information), you may also have the option to use an external dispute resolution scheme (such as AFCA) – we will inform you if that is applicable to your case.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. When we make changes, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the bottom of the policy. If the changes are significant, we may also provide a more prominent notice (such as a banner on our website or direct communication). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information. Your continued use of our website or services after any changes to this Policy will be deemed acceptance of those changes. We will always handle your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy that was in effect at the time of collection, unless we have your consent to treat it differently.
