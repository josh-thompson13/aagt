          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Privacy and Data Usage</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
Your submission of personal information through this Site (for example, as part of a loan application or a contact form) is governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy above to understand how we collect, use, and protect your data
sprintlaw.com.au
. By using this Site or submitting any personal information, you consent to our collection and handling of information in accordance with that policy. In particular, if you apply for a loan, you consent to us conducting credit checks and verifying your information with third parties as described in the Privacy Policy and the Loan Application Terms below.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Loan Application Terms</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
When you submit a business loan application via our Site, the following additional terms and acknowledgments apply to you:

Business Purpose Declaration: You confirm that any loan you apply for through our Site will be used solely for business or commercial purposes, and not for personal, household, or domestic purposes. Our loans are business loans only. By proceeding with an application, you acknowledge that consumer credit laws (including the National Consumer Credit Protection Act) may not apply to this loan if it is strictly for business purposes. We rely on your representation regarding the purpose of the loan.

Truthful and Accurate Information: You agree that all information you provide in the loan application (and any subsequent information or documentation you provide in support of your application) is true, accurate, and complete to the best of your knowledge. You must not knowingly provide any false or misleading information. Providing false information may not only lead to rejection of your application, but could also be considered fraud or have other legal consequences.

Authority to Apply: If you are applying on behalf of a company, partnership, or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the necessary authority to bind that entity to a loan agreement. Similarly, if you list other principals (e.g. co-directors, partners, guarantors), you confirm that you have their consent to include their personal information and to submit the application on their behalf.

Consent to Credit Checks and Verification: By submitting an application, you authorise AAGT Pvt Loans to make any inquiries necessary to verify your information and to assess your creditworthiness
aaafinancegroup.com
. This includes obtaining credit reports about you (and your business) from credit reporting bodies, contacting your employer or financial references, and validating identification details with official databases. We may also exchange information about you with other credit providers or trade references you have provided, but only as allowed by law and outlined in our Privacy Policy. These checks are standard practice in credit assessment, and we will handle all obtained information securely.

No Guarantee of Approval: Submitting an application does not guarantee that you will receive a loan. All loan applications are subject to our review and approval criteria, which consider factors such as credit history, financial position, and our risk assessment. We reserve the right to decline an application at our sole discretion and without providing reasons, to the extent permitted by law.

Loan Agreement: If your loan application is approved, you will be required to sign a separate loan agreement (and possibly associated documents such as a guarantee or security agreement, if applicable). The loan agreement will contain the detailed terms governing the loan, including interest rates, fees, repayment schedule, events of default, and other important conditions. Those specific loan contract terms will prevail over any general descriptions on this Site. Until a formal loan agreement is executed by both you and AAGT Pvt Loans, neither party is legally bound to proceed with the loan. In other words, these Website Terms and your application constitute an offer and preliminaries, not a finalized loan contract.

Electronic Communications: You consent to receive communications from us electronically in relation to your application and loan. We may contact you via email, SMS, or through the online portal. You agree that any notices, disclosures and communications we provide electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. Please ensure you provide a valid email and promptly update us if your contact details change.

Fraud Prevention: For security and fraud prevention, we may decline an application or end communication if we suspect unauthorized or fraudulent activity. We may also report suspicious details to relevant authorities. Ensure that you personally (or an authorised officer) complete the application, and do not use the identity of another person without lawful authority.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Disclaimer – No Financial Advice and Website Information</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
General Information Only: The material on our Site is provided for general information purposes and convenience. While we strive to ensure that all information displayed (including loan product details, eligibility criteria, interest rates, FAQs, articles, and calculators, if any) is accurate and up to date, we do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability or completeness of any information on the Site. The Site’s content is not tailored to your personal circumstances. In particular, nothing on this Site constitutes financial advice, legal advice, or an offer of finance to you on its own. You should not rely solely on the general information on our Site to make financial decisions. We recommend you seek independent advice or contact us directly for personalized information regarding our loan products. Any reliance you place on information from the Site is at your own risk.

No Warranty: To the extent allowed by law, the Site and all content and services provided through it are provided “as is” and “as available” without any warranty or guarantee. We do not promise that the Site will be available at all times, or that it will be provided error-free or free of viruses. Although we use reasonable efforts to maintain an operational and secure website, we disclaim any liability for any harm or loss arising from the transmission of any virus, or from any downtime or technical issues that may affect the Site. You are responsible for using up-to-date antivirus and security software on your own devices.

Third-Party Content: Our Site may include links to third-party websites or display information provided by third parties (for example, testimonials or industry news). These links and content are provided for your convenience. We do not endorse or assume responsibility for third-party websites or materials. Accessing any third-party site via a link on our Site is solely at your own risk. We encourage you to review the terms and policies of any third-party sites you visit. We are not liable for the content or practices of any external sites.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
Limitation: To the fullest extent permitted by Australian law, AAGT Pvt Loans and its directors, officers, employees and agents exclude all liability for any loss or damage (including any direct, indirect, special or consequential loss, loss of profits, loss of data, or damage to computer systems) arising out of or in connection with your use of this Site, any content or services obtained through the Site, or any inability to use the Site. This limitation of liability applies to any cause of action (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise) and to any loss however caused, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. In short, while we aim to provide a helpful and secure website, we will not be responsible for losses resulting from your use of or reliance on our Site. For example, we are not liable if you suffer losses because the Site was unavailable, or because you used information on our Site to make a decision, or for any errors or omissions in our content
sprintlaw.com.au
.

Australian Consumer Law: Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude, restrict, or modify any rights you may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (including the Australian Consumer Law) or any other legislation which may apply and which cannot be excluded. If that law implies warranties or guarantees into our agreement with you that cannot be excluded, then to the extent permitted by law, our liability for breach of such a warranty or guarantee is limited (at our option) to either: (a) resupplying the relevant services or information to you, or (b) paying the cost of having those services or information resupplied. However, if you are using this Site for business purposes, you agree that any consumer guarantees or similar legislation that might apply are expressly excluded to the extent lawful. We draw your attention to the fact that some liabilities – such as certain statutory guarantees – cannot legally be excluded under Australian law
sprintlaw.com.au
, so the above exclusion may not apply to you in those circumstances.

Indemnity: You agree to indemnify and hold harmless AAGT Pvt Loans and its officers and employees from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, or expenses (including legal costs) arising out of your breach of these Terms or your improper use of the Site. This means if a third party makes a claim against us due to your actions (for example, you posted content you didn’t have the right to, or you violated the law using our Site), you will cover our costs and losses.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Changes to Terms and the Site</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
We may from time to time update, amend, or discontinue any part of the Site or its content at our discretion. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we do so, we will post the revised Terms on this page with an updated effective date. Material changes to the Terms may also be noted via a notice on the Site. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically. By continuing to use the Site after changes are made, you agree to the revised Terms. If you do not agree to a change, you should stop using the Site. No oral or written communication by our staff can vary these Terms.
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
          <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
These Terms and your use of the Site are governed by the laws of the State of Queensland and the Commonwealth of Australia. You agree that any dispute arising under or relating to these Terms or the Site shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Queensland, Australia, and courts entitled to hear appeals from those courts
sprintlaw.com.au
. We operate our website from Queensland, and these Terms take effect as a contract made in Queensland. However, we make no representation that the content of the Site is appropriate or available for use in other locations, and accessing it from territories where its contents are illegal is prohibited.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be severed from the Terms and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision.
